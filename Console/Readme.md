#Console

this is a simple module to allow an extra output only console window in python.
see stack overflow (here)[https://stackoverflow.com/a/53617779/3185884]

note that this is output only, no console keyboard input will be displayed or reported to the parent process.
This example can be frozen using cx_Freeze as long as it is added to the setup file as a standalone exe.
